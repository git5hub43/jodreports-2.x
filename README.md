JODReports 2.x Series: Canonical Source Code Repository
=======================================================

This repository contains the most up-to-date clone of JODReports' Subversion (svn) repository, formerly hosted
on SourceForge and located at https://jodreports.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jodreports/

It is intended as a basis in case maintenance is required for the older 2.x series of JODReports.

There is currently one branches:
* sourceforge

The "sourceforge" branch contains **all** commits of the *trunk* of the SourceForge subversion repository, plus this README.md
file. We won't accept any pull requests on this branch. Consider this branch a "tag".

If maintenance should be required for the 2.x series, the most up-to-date maintenance version of the source code should live
in a branch named "develop".
