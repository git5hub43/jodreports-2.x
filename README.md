JODReports 2.x Series: Canonical Source Code Repository
=======================================================

This repository contains the most up-to-date clone of JODReports' Subversion (svn) repository, formerly hosted
on SourceForge and located at https://jodreports.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jodreports/

It is intended as a basis in case maintenance is required for the older 2.x series of JODReports.

There are two branches:
* develop
* sourceforge

The "sourceforge" branch contains **all** commits of the *trunk* of the SourceForge subversion repository, plus this README.md
file. We won't accept any pull requests on this branch. Consider this branch a "tag".

The "develop" branch should contain the most up-to-date maintenance version of the JODReports 2.x series.
