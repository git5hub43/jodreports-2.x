This repository contains the most up-to-date clone of the former SourceForge SVN repository of JODReports, located
at https://jodreports.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jodreports/

It is intended as a basis for potential maintenance requirements of the older 2.x series of JODReports.

There are two branches:
* develop
* sourceforge

The "sourceforge" branch contains the SVN Repository as hosted on SourceForge at the time the repository was
migrated to git/github, plus this README. We won't accept any pull requests on this branch. Consider this branch a "tag".

The "develop" branch should contain the most up-to-date maintenance version of the JODReports 2.x series.
